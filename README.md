# D2TARA Self-Assessment Tool

The web-based tool is based on the D2TARA maturity model and is used for self-assessment of TARAs regarding the use of external data sources. 
The tool is available at https://kriskoett.github.io/D2TARA/.

## Features
- On the left side of the application, the user performs a self-assessment of a TARA by answering questions about the use of external data sources for each data-driven TARA section. Additional questions are presented to the user only after the visible questions have been answered. The questions are used to determine the capability level (per data-driven TARA section).
- On the right side of the application, the achieved capability levels are visualized in a radar chart and the resulting overall TARA maturity level is displayed.

## Additional Material
An overview of our standard pool of external data sources is provided in the standardpool.xlsx spreadsheet. Note that the data sources included are not exhaustive and can be expanded and customized to meet an organization's specific needs.
